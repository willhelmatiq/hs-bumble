# Welcome to Bee Design System
<div className="subheading">About Bee</div>

Beee is a design system inspired and built by like-minded passionates: 
designers, engineers and researchers. It is created to ensure a consistent, 
accessible and accountable user experience across all the platforms of Bumble Inc. 
The Beee’s aim is to provide engineers, researchers and designers with an extensive yet 
easy to use tool for the ultimate benefit of users. The design system is built on a basis of Figma and Stencil. 

<div className="subheading">Core Principles</div>
<div className="subsubheading">Make meaningful user experiences</div>
All the products, solutions and resources created should aim at providing users better experience, 
serve their needs and add marginal value to them. 

<div className="subsubheading">Be part of the community</div>
The Beee is built to improve user experience. We encourage sharing ideas, feedback, contribution and co-creation. 

<div className="subsubheading">Treat with respect and regard diversity</div>
At Beee we set one of main values as equality and respect. We work hard to provide 
a universal solution and care a lot about ethics and the way we approach our users. 
Our team implements the highest accessibility standards following the WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines. 
It is a priority for us to make a lovable product for all the diverse user audience.  

<div className="subheading">Target Audience</div>
Our core target audience are dedicated UX research, engineering and design practitioners willing to build a cohesive valuable solution. 

<div className="subheading">Style guidelines</div>
<div className="subsubheading">Colors</div>
At Beee we identify and set color schemes and patterns that can be used to design consistently with respect to the brand. 
Colors are one of leading means of digital communication and translate brand’s identity, mood and can drive user behavior. 

Normally, we use one primary color and a secondary color both of different depths and a warm gray and a cold gray neutral 
palette to serve as a base for the brand colors. We also provide a set of success, warning and danger colors to communicate 
feedback to a user. 

Main color is a sunglow color (yellowish-warm). It sets the mind of:
- Optimistic and exciting
- Values people
- Signifies communication
- Intellectual, imaginative, and idealistic

Secondary color is a calm blue. It indicates:
- Respect
- Trustworthiness
- Reliability
- Neutral gray palette indicated solid basement, confidence, ground and compromise. 

We provide color tokens and user scenarios for each color picked for more cohesive designing. 

<div className="subsubheading">Typography</div>
<div className="subsubheading">Inner Font</div>
Inter UI is a typeface specially designed for user interfaces with a focus on high legibility of 
small-to-medium sized text on computer screens. The family features a tall x-height to aid in 
readability of mixed-case and lower-case text. 

<div className="subsubheading">Font Weights</div>
To maintain a light, clean look, Beee does not use a weight stronger than semibold.

<div className="subheading">Content Guidelines</div>
Content guidelines provide principles and best practices around writing for user 
experience along with general voice and style guidance.

<div className="subsubheading">Why Important</div>
Microcopy, or every word, phrase, message or article a user sees in an application matters. 
Inconsistent, erroneous or disrespectful copy doesn’t add any value. Elaborated and convincing copy, 
on the other hand, is an integral part of UX design.

<div className="subsubheading">Goal</div>
- Create a monolithic communication pattern across products and applications
- Cultivate a kind and inclusive perception of products
- Promote brand and its values among all user scenarios

<div className="subsubheading">Voice and Tone</div>
A brand tone of voice defines how a brand personality sounds across any written or verbal content. 
While a brand uses multiple tones depending on a situation, context and emotion they are willing to 
express, brand voice should always remain unchanged. It is one of stand away features, by which users 
recognize the brand along with brand color, logo etc.

Beee’s voice is:
- Friendly
- Engaging
- Respectful

<div className="subsubheading">Freindly voice notes</div>
<div className="parentGrid">
  <p>DOs</p>
  <p>DONTs</p>
  <p>Use positive affirmations and wording</p>
  <p>Avoid excessive use of no/not </p>
  <p>Treat users personally, when suitable</p>
  <p>Robotic, one-suit-all copy</p>
  <p>Communicate in plain language, avoid very difficult words</p>
  <p>Overcomplicated, nested sentences with mind bending terms</p>
  <p>Ideally microcopy should sound like a talk, not a snobbish monologue</p>
  <p> </p>
</div>

<div className="subsubheading">Engaging voice notes</div>
<div className="parentGrid1">
  <p>DOs</p>
  <p>DONTs</p>
  <p>Express your intention. Clearly. Brief. Right to the point</p>
  <p>Don’t go in circles, and circles..and circles</p>
  <p>Collaborate with user</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Refer to users when possible to create a connection </p>
  <p>Stay-aside, isolated sounding. You are here for the user. </p>
</div>

<div className="subsubheading">Respectful voice notes</div>
<div className="parentGrid1">
  <p>DOs</p>
  <p>DONTs</p>
  <p>Communicate in a way that includes everyone</p>
  <p>Don’t use very specific jokes, references and never make any culture-specific examples</p>
  <p>“Press the “learn more” button”</p>
  <p>“Press the “yellow” button</p>
  <p>Express your opinion. Contradiction is ok, but should never be offensive</p>
  <p>Don’t say other people are wrong; furthermore, don’t do it in impolite way</p>
</div>


Depending on a type of communication and current user experience or journey several tones can be used.

Beee’s tone might be:
- encouraging
- clarifying
- narrating

A couple of examples demonstrating the usage of tones follows:
- Wow. A user has just upgraded his/her account. You are willing to 
congratulate him/her with an encouraging tone. 
- An employee had some issues yesterday when she tried to log in to a 
new working portal. You will send her some additional information or 
a link with FAQ. Do it using a clarifying tone.
- The developers worked hard and you are releasing a new version 
of an app this year. It introduces a bunch of new features. Once a user 
downloads it, you will drive him/her through a real-estate tour of what is 
new. Use a narrating tone for that.  


<div className="subsubheading">Content checklist</div>
The copy will fail if:
- Inappropriate or ambiguous wording is used
- Too official tone and complex syntax structure
- The copy is misleading or offensive
- The copy explicitly highlights different levels of accessibility
- There are misprints or punctuation is disregarded 
The copy will pass if: 
- The wording is clear and univocal
- Simple structure of sentences. Vivid and friendly tone
- No hidden meaning is used. All copy abides by “equality and respect” rule by default
- All the content embraces accessibility guidelines. However, leveling is never spoken out loud
- All the texts are always to be checked by a redactor. 

Writing for all audiences
It is paramount to design, including writing, with all users’ abilities in mind. 
The best practice is to comply to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) guidelines.
